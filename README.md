This repository is made for the development of the codes that will be used in the event that is organized by the society.
The event will be organized on 14th Feb, 2026 in the campus of Jamia Milla Islamia.
The event is called Treasure Hunt.
In this we will interact with the participant in such a way that there will be QR Codes hidden inside the campus at various location and the participants have to scan those QR Codes
and eventually reach the treasure; only one team will be able to reach the treaure because we have designed the game and codes in such a way.
This is how the game will be conducted and how this repository will contain codes that will be used in this game.
This game is conducted to interact not just various divisions of the society but also to advertise that society is not just tech-oriented, the society also conducts entertaining events for the people.
